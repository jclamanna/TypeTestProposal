><h2><font size =4><strong><ins>Project Abstract </ins></strong></font></h2>

   <p>The goal for this project is to create a typing test that has an account system. Users will be able to take typing tests and track statisitics through their account. These stats could be (but are not limited to):</p>
  
   <li><strong>Last Test WPM</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Total Average WPM</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Improvements Over Time Spent</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Most Missed Letter</strong></li>
  
   <p>I think the stats I have come up with are a good start but may be expanded on or changed in the future. The following is a loose UML diagram showing what I think the basic program structure could look like:

><h2><font size =4><strong><ins>Project Relevance</ins></strong></font></h2>
	<p>This project falls in line with many of our course education goals. We will have to employ object oriented design concepts in order to implement and account system and a test manager that handles taking the test.</p>
	<p>I think that using things like UML and possibly common design patterns would aid in this process. Additionally, test driven development can be useful in developing the statistics portion of this project. The test is going to need a GUI and also access to a database in order to manage user account data </p>
	<p> Lastly, in order to complete this task we will need to employ good project management, including version control and issue tracking espedcially. This is because there are a lot of moving parts to this project. </p>

    <ul>I think I would do best at developing the test manager and statistic tracking and probably some of the account and database work. I would say my week point is developing a clean GUI so anyone with GUI skills that like this idea, lets make it! Other than coding, I am well versed on GitHub and should be able to help keep the project organized while the team works on it. I am also fairly familiar with UML Structure Diagrams and think I can contribute a lot when coming up with design ideas for this project.</ul>
